🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of credit card spending trends across Indian states, with the goal of uncovering financial behaviors, regional patterns, and actionable insights using data science techniques. It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for future machine learning applications or dashboarding tools.

🧩 Objective
Understand the trend and patterns of credit card usage in India.

Identify high and low performing states in terms of credit card transactions.

Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it machine learning-ready.

Generate actionable insights for financial institutions or policy makers.

🔍 Problem Statement
India is experiencing rapid financial digitization. Understanding regional credit card spending behavior is vital for:

Tailoring financial products.

Evaluating economic activity.

Supporting regional financial planning.

However, the available data is unstructured, includes missing values, inconsistent column naming, and regional disparities. This project addresses these issues through rigorous preprocessing and analysis.

📊 Dataset Description (Credit Card Spending in India.csv)
This dataset consists of monthly data points representing credit card transaction volumes and values for various states and union territories in India.

Key Columns:
State/UT: Name of the region (e.g., Maharashtra, Delhi)

Month: Time period of data (monthly)

Transactions: Number of credit card transactions

Amount: Total transaction value (INR)

Category (if available): Online vs. Offline or Point of Sale, etc.

Data Characteristics:
Multiple null values for smaller states or territories.

Inconsistent capitalization and formatting in state names.

Time-based data suitable for temporal trend analysis.

🔍 Detailed Steps Performed
1. Data Exploration
Summary statistics, value counts, missing value checks.

Distribution of credit usage across months and states.

2. Data Cleaning
Standardized column names for consistency.

Removed null values or imputed where appropriate.

Harmonized state names (e.g., "Andaman & Nicobar Islands" vs. "Andaman and Nicobar").

3. Feature Engineering
Created Month-Year columns for time-series handling.

Aggregated total spend per state for each month.

Created rolling averages to identify regional trends.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Top 10 states by credit card usage.

Temporal trends (spikes around festive seasons).

Correlation between transaction count and transaction value.

Geographical insights on credit behavior.

5. Preprocessing for ML
Scaled and encoded categorical variables (if required).

Handled outliers using statistical thresholds.

Final dataset exported or ready to be passed into predictive models.

📈 Key Insights
Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka lead in credit card spending.

Usage spikes consistently in October to December, suggesting festive and end-of-year spending patterns.

Smaller UTs and Northeast states have significantly lower penetration, indicating a gap in credit-based transactions.

Transaction volume and value are highly correlated in high-income urban areas.

💡 Potential Applications
Credit Risk Modeling: Financial institutions can use cleaned data for building models that assess creditworthiness by geography.

Targeted Marketing: Identify where to launch new credit card products based on current usage.

Economic Analysis: Serve as a proxy indicator of state-level financial behavior and digitization.

🚀 Future Scope
Integrate with demographic or income datasets to evaluate socioeconomic influences.

Develop forecasting models for monthly spending prediction.

Build interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit) for dynamic reporting.

Implement clustering models to group similar states based on financial behavior.
